## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I improved the sementic of my HTML, and in addition got to practice basic CSS principels.

```css
.social-card .user-skills-list p {
  width: 290px;
  height: 40px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  text-align: center;
  align-content: center;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  font-weight: 300;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving on writing less complicated code to get to my solution. I should focus on creating variables for things I repeat this will make it easier when someone else is editing the code.
